# Coding Guides and Best Practices

Code quality impacts not just developers’ experience, but also [business values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRR0EDazxIk).
According to the [research](https://codescene.com/blog/measuring-the-business-impact-of-low-code-quality),

* 23~42% of developer’s time is wasted due to technical debt and bad code
* High quality code has 
  * 15 times fewer bugs
  * twice the development speed
  * 9 times lower uncertainty in completion time

Maintaining good code quality starts with having team convention and consistently sticking to it. 

This repo is my curated collection of coding guides and best practices to help set up coding conventions.
